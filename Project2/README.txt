To run the program, use the following command: python ann.py <filename> [h <number of hidden nodes> | p <holdout percentage> ], as specified in the project, using Python 2.7.
The program will return the mean of the error of the test data.
We used the NumPy library to allow us to use matrix math; special thanks to Welch Labs.
