	In order to determine that our heuristic function was valid, we calculated it manually to play several games against human players,
ourselves and anyone nearby.  By trying to minimize the number of moves that our algorithm (Max) needed to make and maximizing the 
number of moves the opponent needed to make (Min), we were able to determine that, while not necessarily optimal, it was capable of 
competing against other, presumably logical agents.  Though very simple, it works well.
